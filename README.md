# lstm-story-generator
A story generator using long short term memory units.

If you want to use your own text, replace the text in 'train.txt' with your text. 
Make sure you remove any characters that come up less number of times in your text. In my case, I had to remove '%' and '*'.
You will have to rename the file names in "story_generator.py" from 'model-final.json' to 'model.json' and 'weights-final.h5' to 'weights.h5' respectively.
That's it. Happy generating! 


Based on a Keras example.
